# Description

This "Mobile Flashcards" App is designed to help users study. They can create an unlimited amount of Flashcard Decks, which they can use to quiz themselves on various topics. For each deck they can specify the topic, and add cards with 1 question and 1 answer each. When they take the quiz they will see only the question until they have submitted their answer. The cards do not determine if the answer is correct, but the user is able to track their score as they go through the deck by grading each question. They have the option to restart a deck at any point.

This project was bootstrapped with [Expo aka. Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
It is built using React Native and Redux, with React Navigation v3.

# Setup:

First install the Expo CLI tool:

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Clone this project and run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.<br>

After starting the server the Expo CLI tool will give you 2 options:

1. It will open up a browser window where you can choose to run your app on an iOS simulator, send a link to your device, etc.

2. In your terminal you will see options on how you can run your app on an iOS simulator, send a link to your device, etc.

Notes:

* You must [setup XCode](https://itunes.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835) first in order to run this app on a simulator/emulator).
* You must install the Expo app and make an account in order to run this app locally on your own device.
* Reading these [docs](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v32.0.0/workflow/up-and-running/) will give you some handy tips for developing.


By default live reloading is enabled<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
